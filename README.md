## Summary
The objective of the project is to train a Random Forest Regressor using Scikit-learn library, which will be used to predict resale values of the cars.
The required data is taken from cardekho website.
## Implementation details
1. Import the data from csv file into Pandas dataframe  
2. Perform data pre-processning to get relevant data  
3. Visualize the data to understand patterns and correlations  
4. Create train and test data  
5. Import RandomForest regressor from sklearn.ensemble  
6. Create list of possible values of hyperparameters to use RandomizedSsearchCV to pick best parameters  
7. Use distplots in sns library to visualize the predictions
